To edit the game:

1. Open GameMaker-Studio 1.3, click open, and go to where the github is and select the folder Game and then GameMaker.

2. Then open Projects and select GettaLife from there you should see an option in the right box, select that to open it.
	It should be called something like "Getta Life.project"

Good Luck! :)
